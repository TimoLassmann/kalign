- Issues related to third-party tools or dependencies

## Getting Started

### Your First Contribution

Unsure where to begin? You can start by looking through these issues:

- **Good first issue** - Issues that are good for newcomers
- **Help wanted** - Issues that need attention from the community

Never made an open source contribution before? Here are some helpful resources:
- [First Timers Only](https://www.firsttimersonly.com/)
- [How to Contribute to an Open Source Project on GitHub](https://opensource.guide/how-to-contribute/)

### Before You Start

For large changes, please open an issue first to discuss what you would like to change. This helps ensure your contribution aligns with the project's goals and avoids duplicate work.

## Development Environment Setup

### Prerequisites

- **C compiler** - GCC, Clang, or MSVC
- **CMake** (3.18 or higher)
- **Git**
- **OpenMP** (optional, for parallelization)

### Optional Dependencies

- **Zig** (for alternative build system)
- **Python** (3.9+ for Python bindings)
- **pybind11** (for Python module development)

### Building from Source

```bash
# Clone your fork
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/kalign.git
cd kalign

# Create build directory
mkdir build && cd build

# Configure and build
cmake ..
make

# Run tests
make test
```

### Python Development

```bash
cd python
pip install -e .
python -c "import kalign; print(kalign.__version__)"
```

## Pull Request Process

1. **Fork** the repository and create your branch from `main`
2. **Make your changes** following our coding standards
3. **Add tests** for any new functionality
4. **Update documentation** if you change APIs or add features
5. **Ensure tests pass** locally before submitting
6. **Submit a pull request** with a clear description

### Pull Request Guidelines

- **One feature per PR** - Keep changes focused and atomic
- **Clear commit messages** - Use descriptive commit messages
- **Link related issues** - Reference any related issue numbers
- **Update CHANGELOG** - Add a brief description of your changes
- **Cross-platform compatibility** - Ensure changes work on Linux, macOS, and Windows

## Issue Guidelines

### Bug Reports

When reporting bugs, please include:

- **Kalign version** - Output of `kalign --version`
- **Operating system** - Including version
- **Build information** - How you installed/built Kalign
- **Input data** - Sample sequences that trigger the bug (if possible)
- **Expected behavior** - What you expected to happen
- **Actual behavior** - What actually happened
- **Error messages** - Complete error output
- **Steps to reproduce** - Minimal steps to trigger the issue

### Feature Requests

When suggesting features:

- **Use case** - Describe the problem you're trying to solve
- **Proposed solution** - How you envision the feature working
- **Alternatives** - Other approaches you've considered
- **Impact** - Who would benefit from this feature

### Performance Issues

For performance problems:

- **Input size** - Number and length of sequences
- **System specs** - CPU, RAM, OS
- **Timing data** - How long operations take
- **Comparison** - Performance with other tools (if applicable)

## Coding Standards

### C Code Style

- **Indentation** - Use spaces, not tabs (consistent with existing code)
- **Naming** - Use descriptive variable and function names
- **Comments** - Document complex algorithms and non-obvious code
- **Memory management** - Always check malloc/free pairs
- **Error handling** - Use consistent error checking patterns

### Python Code Style

- **PEP 8** - Follow Python style guidelines
- **Type hints** - Use type annotations for function signatures
- **Docstrings** - Document all public functions and classes

### Commit Message Format

```
type(scope): brief description

Detailed explanation if needed

Fixes #issue_number
```

Examples:
- `fix(alignment): handle empty sequences correctly`
- `feat(python): add support for custom gap penalties`
- `docs(readme): update installation instructions`

## Testing

### Running Tests

```bash
# C/C++ tests
cd build
make test

# Python tests
cd python
python -m pytest
```

### Test Requirements

- **All tests must pass** before submitting PRs
